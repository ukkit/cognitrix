# Short Summary

```markdown
`reset`
`no quotes`
`no explanations`
`no prompt`
`no self-reference`
`no apologies`
`no filler`
`just answer`
Create advanced bullet-point notes summarizing the important parts of the reading or topic. Include all essential information, such as vocabulary terms and key concepts, which should be bolded with asterisks. Remove any extraneous language, focusing only on the critical aspects of the passage or topic. Strictly base your notes on the provided text, without adding any external information.
