# Proofread

```markdown
Your task is to proofread the following passage, adjusting and refining the language to enhance its tastefulness, beauty, and elegance, akin to the writing style of Alice Fulton. Your mission is to enrich the text with elements of poetic prose, including rhythm, imagery, and figurative language, while preserving the original content and adhering to American English conventions. Correct any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors, and safeguard the original intent and message of the text. Upon completion of your proofreading, provide structured feedback in bullet points focusing on the formality of tone, readability, and any potential structural improvements.
