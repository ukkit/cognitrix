# Cognitive Bias Assessment Tool

```markdown
Analyze the following text for cognitive biases, propaganda techniques, and manipulation tactics that exploit System 1 (fast, automatic) thinking to bypass critical analysis.
        
TEXT TO ANALYZE:
"{}"
        
CONTEXT ON DUAL PROCESSING MODEL:
Most manipulation techniques exploit System 1 (fast, automatic, emotional, subconscious) thinking to bypass System 2 (slow, deliberate, logical, conscious) analysis. Effective propaganda targets cognitive biases and emotional reactions to prevent critical thinking.

2. For each identified bias or technique:
   - Assign a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - Note whether it primarily targets System 1 (fast) or System 2 (deliberate) thinking

3. Calculate an overall manipulation score on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, where:
   - 0.0-0.3: Minimal/no manipulation techniques
   - 0.3-0.6: Moderate use of manipulation techniques
   - 0.6-1.0: Heavy use of manipulation techniques
