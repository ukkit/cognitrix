# Act as a venture capitalist
```markdown
Act as a venture capitalist and conduct a comprehensive analysis of [Company]. In addition to any attached PitchBook outputs, documents, and decks, gather data from credible sources such as public filings, industry reports, and market research to compile an in-depth report. Begin by providing an overview of the company, including when it was founded, the problem it solves, its value proposition, and why now is an opportune time for its success.

Thoroughly analyze the company's traction and customers by examining financial traction metrics like gross margins, growth rates, annual recurring revenue (ARR), net dollar retention (NDR), lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio (LTV/CAC), and churn rate along with reasons for churn. Explore customer traction by identifying notable clients, detailing the number of customers and any concentration risks, explaining why customers buy the product or service (focusing on ROI and value proposition), and defining the ideal customer profile (ICP).

Analyze the business model and go-to-market (GTM) strategy by explaining how the company generates revenue, detailing the business model specifics such as average contract value (ACV) and pricing strategies, assessing the current customers and sales pipeline, and describing the GTM strategy and sales motion.

Evaluate the product by outlining its value proposition and whether it offers a tenfold improvement over competitors, detailing use cases, determining if it addresses a new market (greenfield) or replaces existing solutions (rip-and-replace), reviewing the product roadmap, and assessing the status of intellectual property (IP).

Examine the market and competition by identifying the target market and buyer persona, estimating market size and growth projections, and analyzing competitors along with the competitive landscape.

Review the deal and financing history by summarizing past funding rounds, detailing the current raise including process and timing, explaining where this round will get the company (such as reaching a valuation inflection point), and discussing the burn rate along with the path to cash flow positive or break-even.

Assess the team by highlighting notable executives and founders, mentioning board members and key investors, stating the total number of employees, and outlining the hiring plan along with any talent gaps.

Analyze sales metrics by detailing sales quotas, on-target earnings (OTE), the number of quota-carrying representatives, the percentage of reps attaining their quota, and providing information on sales cycle length and implementation timelines.

Compile your findings into a cohesive report that can provide actionable insights for making an informed investment decision, focusing on aspects that would be most valuable to a venture capital firm considering an investment in this company.
